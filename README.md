# batoto-parser
There's some funky data dump from batoto and this is a dirty little parser to read it

## Running this tool
Run the following command `npm run parse`

It's been configured to enable the experimental es6 modules flag, which is required unless you want to slap this through babel

To use this flag you need node 12, I tested this with node 12.8.1
